## A Simple Database project using MySql, PHP for backend and HTML,CSS for frontend. ##
---
- Here the user can register a complaint or a request or a traffic issue and it is stored in the database. 
- Based on the keywords used the problem is assigned a priority. - And based non the priority police officers are assigned to that particular problem. - There is a status assigned to each police officer for the availability. - Because of its simple structure, a problem is removed from the table and the officer for that problem is freed(Police officer is now available).
